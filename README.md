# Lab 10: Bias Correction Implementation

**Date:** October 31, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 10

## Overview

This lab focuses on implementing bias correction methods for climate model outputs. Students will code bias correction algorithms, validate their effectiveness statistically, and understand the important trade-offs involved, particularly how bias correction can break physical correlations in climate data.

## Topics Covered

- Bias correction coding and implementation
- Statistical validation of bias correction methods
- Understanding how bias correction breaks physical correlations
- Quantile mapping and other bias correction techniques
- Trade-offs between bias reduction and correlation preservation

## Objectives

- Implement bias correction algorithms for climate data
- Validate bias correction methods statistically
- Understand how bias correction can break physical correlations
- Evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of different approaches

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab provides the bias correction tools that students will use for PS2 Task 4, enabling them to properly process climate model outputs for hydrological impact studies while understanding the inherent limitations and trade-offs.
