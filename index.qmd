## Background and Reading

<!-- Content will be added here -->

## Tasks

Modify the code section below to address the following tasks.

1. Implement Markov-chain based weather generator for daily precipitation
1. Extend generator to include temperature conditioned on precipitation state
1. Generate long synthetic weather sequences and validate statistical properties
1. Compare synthetic data to observations using multiple validation metrics

## Code

```{julia}
#| output: false
using Pkg
lab_dir = dirname(@__FILE__)
Pkg.activate(lab_dir)
# Pkg.instantiate() # uncomment this the first time you run the lab to install packages, then comment it back
```
